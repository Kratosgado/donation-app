## Project Information

### Problem Statement

Many non-profit organizations struggle with managing donations effectively due to lack of proper tools. The manual process is time-consuming and prone to errors, leading to inefficiencies and potential loss of donations.

### Project Aims

The aim of this project is to develop a comprehensive donation management platform that simplifies the process of handling donations for non-profit organizations.

### Project Objectives

- Create a user-friendly interface for managing donations.
- Implement a secure system for storing donor information.
- Provide tools for generating detailed donation reports.
- Facilitate the integration of payment gateways for online donations.

### Scope of the Project

The project encompasses the development of a web-based application that includes modules for donor management, donation tracking, and report generation. It also includes integration with popular payment gateways.

### Limitations of the Project

The project is limited to web-based platforms and does not include mobile applications. Additionally, the integration with payment gateways is limited to those that provide APIs.

### Background View

A review of existing literature on donation management systems highlights the common challenges faced by non-profit organizations in managing donations efficiently.

### Review of Existing Applications

In existing websites, the donor has to create an account before they can donate, but it has been reviewed to make it a choice for the donor. Also, in existing sites, the donor has to bring the donations if it is not money, but it has been reviewed to go and take the donation. All the donor has to do is to share with us the location.

### Problem Identification

Despite the availability of several donation management systems, there is a need for a more user-friendly and cost-effective solution tailored to the needs of small to medium-sized non-profit organizations.

### Project Evaluation

The project is evaluated based on its ability to meet the needs of non-profit organizations, its user-friendliness, and the security of donor information.

### Review of Project-Related Methodologies

Agile development methodology has been chosen for its flexibility and ability to incorporate user feedback throughout the development process.
